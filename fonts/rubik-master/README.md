# Rubik Fonts

The Rubik fonts are designed by Philipp Hubert and Sebastian Fischer at http://hubertfischer.com as part of the https://www.chrome.com/cubelab project.

Rubik is a 5 weight Roman + Italic family. 
Rubik Mono One is paired with Rubik One, a proportionally spaced variation of the design.
